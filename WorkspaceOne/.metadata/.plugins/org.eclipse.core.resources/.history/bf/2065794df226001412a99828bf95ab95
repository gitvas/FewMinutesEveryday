    <string name="intro_text">Hi Shiva. I have been especially built to make you start your day with awesome strength and super joy. My developer has vested in me that responsibility and customized me to talk to go and talk to some of my friends on the internet and bring you some cool jokes, awesome photos and inspiring quotes. Please do spend your few minutes every start of your day to see what I bring for you and return me the favor with your cheers. The more cheers, the more meaning in my purpose for existence. And since the sole purpose of my birth was to commemoate your birthday, here are my digital wishes - &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. This is applicable only for the day you receive me. Sadly my creator didn\'t care to feed me the logic to remember your birthdate. Please anticipate it in my 2.0 version. Have a great day ahead.</string>
