    <string name="intro_text">Hi Shiva. I have been especially built to make you start your day with awesome strength and super joy. My developer customized me to go and talk to some of the web servers on the internet and bring you some cool jokes, awesome photos and inspiring quotes. Please do spend your few minutes everyday to see what I bring for you and do me the favor. The more regularly you use me, the more meaning in my purpose for existence. \n\nAnd since the sole purpose of my birth was to commemorate your birthday, here are my special digital wishes - Happy Birthday . This is applicable only for the day you receive me. Sadly my creator didn\'t care to feed me the logic to remember your birthdate. Please anticipate it in my 2.0 version. \n\n Have a great day ahead!!!</string>
